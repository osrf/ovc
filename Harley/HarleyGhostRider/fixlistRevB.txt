**Design**
 * LDO footprint is wrong. Chose one of the 6 different suitable components and retroute accordingly
 * FX3 RST RC couple is wrong. Move C from 2.5V to GND
 * Swap I2C lines for flash memory
 * create cutout in ground plane underneath FX3 SS capacitors, as described on p.17 here: 
   http://www.cypress.com/file/139936/download   consider tweaking layout on the east side
   of the capacitors to try to balanace lengths a bit more, if possible... but there is a
   tradeoff between length-skew matching and the number of bends, and I'm not sure which
   is more important in a case like this. I suspect length matching might be more important
   because on p.18 of that document they say that the SS lines need to be within 0.12mm (!),
   which is sort of amazing.
 * check USB-HS lines; p.20 of that document seems to want somewhat different rules than we have
   currently implemented on the USB-HS traces, such as 90-ohm differential trace impedances.
   Not sure though.
 * that document also says to use an "LC circuit" to connect USB3 cable shield to GND. The FX3
   development kit (DVK) schematics show an 0805 ferrite bead BLM21PG221SN1D being used in series
   with the inbound +5V line, which might help reduce noise somewhat. Also, they show a 100nF
   capacitor in parallel with another BLM21PG221SN1D to connect the shield to GND. I guess that's
   the LC circuit they were describing.
 * debug header test points for MONITOR1 would be nice (for dual/triple-slope timing). Doesn't
   need to go back to GhostRider; just oscilloscope probe points on the imager board
   
 
**BOM only**

 * series termination resistor needed for the SCLK tree leaving the translator IC. 50 ohm seemed to work OK. Not sure what it should really be.
 * add local LDO's for the imagers to reduce noise. Might need/want a 4v switching supply to feed the LDO's to save some power consumption.
